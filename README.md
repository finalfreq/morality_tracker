# Morality Tracker

Morality Tracker was a part of Rails week 4 at Epicodus. The objective was to create a site that uses AJAX to display changes without refreshing the page. There was also additional functionality to have this apply to using a search function and sorting tables. 

## Usage

To run this project you must have rails installed.

Open project in terminal and run bundle to install necessary gems and run the following in terminal.

```
rake db:create
rake db:seed
rake db:migrate
rails s
```

You should then be able to open on localhost:3000. From there you can register a new account and start tracking your morality through your daily choices.
